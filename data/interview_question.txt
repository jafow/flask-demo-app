Please write an application that serves an API end point to fetch and create members from and to the apps local db. 

Use the attached members_data.csv file to load the member info into the app. 


The applications should have end points to do the following:
1. get all members for a given account
2. get member by:
    - id
    - phone_number
    - client_member_id  (this is equivalaent to a medical record number, or mrn)
3. create new member





Extra:
------

Let's assume we want to use this API to upload a csv file
reading the file and adding the members line by line will be a slow process. 
so we want to introduce the concept of batch uploads into this API

Some of the files we receive have duplicate members, or different members with the same phone number or same client_member_id
refer to member_data_with_duplicate_records.csv for example.

We want to enforce uniqueness on phone_number and client_member_id per account. 

Please implement or write out how you would design a csv upload feature that uses the batch API that
enforces uniqueness on phone_number and client_member_id per account.


Note:
- we receive files up to 5 million rows
- the batch API will have a max size limit 1000
